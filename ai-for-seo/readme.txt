== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use *AI for SEO* alongside another SEO plugin? =
Yes, *AI for SEO* is compatible with all major SEO plugins. The metadata generated by *AI for SEO* can be synchronized with popular plugins such as Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, All in One SEO, Slim SEO, SEO Simple Pack, Squirrly SEO, The SEO Framework, and Blog2Social. This ensures your metadata remains up-to-date and seamlessly integrates with your preferred SEO tool.

= How do I avoid duplicate meta tags with other SEO plugins? =
Use the output mode in Settings. Choose between Disable, Force, Replace (default), or Complement existing meta tags to match your setup with Yoast, Rank Math, SEOPress, etc.

= Will the AI tool automatically analyze my content? =
Yes, the AI tool will generate SEO-relevant data based on the content of the selected page, blog post or media file.

= Will *AI for SEO* overwrite my existing metadata or media attributes? =
Not unless you enable it. By default, we don’t overwrite existing data. You can explicitly allow overwriting (and even include “complete” entries) in Settings.

= Can I choose which media attributes the plugin should generate? =
Yes, *AI for SEO* lets you decide which media attributes (like 'alt text' or 'title') should be generated. You can configure this in the 'Active Media Attributes:' section of the settings to match your content needs. Simply select the desired attributes and the SEO Autopilot will generate the data accordingly.

= How are Credits consumed in the *AI for SEO* plugin? =
Credits are used when *AI for SEO* generates metadata for your content (posts, pages, products, media files etc.). The amount of Credits required depends on the selected active meta tags and media attributes (see Settings).

= Do unused Credits expire at the end of the month? =
No, any unused Credits will roll over to the next month, allowing you to fully utilize your Credits without losing them at the end of each billing cycle.

= Can I try the *AI for SEO* plugin without purchasing a subscription? =
Yes, the free plan provides you with 100 Credits, allowing you to experiment with AI-generated SEO content without any cost. In addition, we provide you with 5 free Credits every day if your balance falls below 100 Credits.

= When should I choose a Subscription, Credit Packs, or Pay-As-You-Go? =
1. Choose **Subscription** if you want ongoing features and steady Credits. Subscriptions unlock advanced generation options and provide a continuous flow of Credits for new content over time.
2. Choose **Credit Packs** for one-time top-ups when you need a larger burst of generations. Credit Packs are ideal as an add-on to an active subscription when you temporarily need more Credits.
3. Choose <strong>PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go)</strong> if you prefer automatic top-ups. When your balance falls below 100 Credits, new Credits are added to your account automatically by purchasing a package you selected in advance.

= Does *AI for SEO* support multi-language websites? =
Yes, the plugin does support multi-language websites. The plugin also supports the WPML-plugin through which you can generate metadata and media attributes for all available languages separately.

= Does *AI for SEO* support Multi-Site installations? =
Yes, *AI for SEO* fully supports Multi-Site installations. Simply purchase a subscription on your primary website and use the same license owner and license key across all your sub-sites.

= Can I use *AI for SEO* on a staging or local development site? =
Yes, you can use *AI for SEO* on staging or local development sites.

= What editors are supported? =
*AI for SEO* supports most editors and themes. For extra convenience, we've added dedicated “Generate with AI” buttons in Elementor, BeTheme (Muffin-Builder / Be-Builder), and the standard editor. You can also generate metadata directly from the plugin dashboard, the metadata editor, or SEO Autopilot without using any page builder.

= Can I link multiple sites and share credits/settings? =
Yes. Enter the same license owner + key under *AI for SEO* > Account on each website to link them. Linked websites share the same credits pool, and you can export/import settings between them. Works with Multisite and staging.

= I’m an agency with multiple client websites. How do I set things up? =
1. We recommend setting up your agency *AI for SEO* account via a primary site (e.g., your agency site) and purchasing a subscription there. Alternatively, you can purchase directly on our website: https://aiforseo.ai/pricing
2. After purchasing a subscription, you receive your license owner and key by email and they are also visible in your *AI for SEO* Account area.
3. Install the *AI for SEO* plugin on each client website you manage. Go to *AI for SEO* > Account on each website.
4. Enter the **same license owner + key** to link them to the same account. Linked websites share the same subscription and Credits pool.

= Does *AI for SEO* collect or store my content? =
*AI for SEO* sends only the text needed to generate metadata to our AI service. We don’t add tracking scripts to your site, and we don’t publish your content. You can review privacy options (generator hints, white-label, incognito) under *AI for SEO* > Account > Privacy & Agreements.

= Can I control who can use *AI for SEO* in my WordPress? =
Yes. In Settings, you can restrict access by user role. Agencies can also use Incognito and White-Label options in *AI for SEO* > Account.

= Is AI-generated SEO-content harmful to my SEO-ranking? =
Currently, Google's stance on the use of AI or automation in content creation is generally permissive, as indicated in a Google Developers blog post from February 2023. They state that appropriate use of AI or automation is not against their guidelines. More information can be found at [https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content).

= Will all the generated data disappear if I uninstall the plugin? =
It depends on how the metadata is stored and used. If *AI for SEO* has synchronized the generated metadata with a third-party SEO plugin like Yoast SEO, RankMath, SEOPress, or similar, then the metadata will remain even after uninstalling *AI for SEO*. You can check and enable synchronization in your *AI for SEO* settings. However, if synchronization was not enabled during generation, then those meta tags will disappear once the plugin is deactivated or uninstalled.

= Can you add feature x, y or z to the plugin? =
We are always open to suggestions and feedback. Please email us at [info@aiforseo.ai](mailto:info@aiforseo.ai) with your suggestions.
