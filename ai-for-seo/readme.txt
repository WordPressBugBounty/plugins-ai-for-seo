== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use *AI for SEO* alongside another SEO plugin? =
Yes, *AI for SEO* is compatible with all major SEO plugins. The metadata generated by *AI for SEO* can be synchronized with popular plugins such as Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, All in One SEO, Slim SEO, SEO Simple Pack, Squirrly SEO, The SEO Framework, and Blog2Social. This ensures your metadata remains up-to-date and seamlessly integrates with your preferred SEO tool.

= How do I activate the synchronization with another SEO plugin? =
To enable synchronization with another SEO plugin:
- Navigate to the plugin settings and locate the 'Sync 'AI for SEO' Changes:' section.
- Check the box next to your desired SEO plugin to activate syncing.
If you're using the SEO Autopilot (bulk generation) feature, make sure the relevant meta tags are enabled in the 'Overwrite Existing Metadata (SEO Autopilot Only):' section to replace outdated data within your existing SEO plugin.

= What are the benefits of providing SEO metadata for my website? =
Providing SEO metadata helps search engines better understand your content, which can lead to higher rankings in search results. This improvement in visibility can drive more clicks, visitors, sales, and leads to your website.

= What are the benefits of providing alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for images on my website? =
Including image metadata helps search engines better interpret your images, potentially boosting your rankings in image search results and the overall quality of your website. In addition, it also shows your commitment to accessibility, catering to a wider audience and complying with accessibility standards.

= Will the AI tool automatically analyze my content? =
Yes, the AI tool will generate SEO-relevant data based on the content of the selected page, blog post or media file.

= How can I automate the process of generating metadata for my website? =
You can automate the generation of metadata by selecting the desired content type within the 'Set up SEO Autopilot' modal. This modal can be accessed by clicking the 'Set up SEO Autopilot'-button within the 'SEO Autopilot (Bulk Generation)'-section on the *AI for SEO* dashboard of your WordPress website.

= How can I automate the process of generating alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for images on my website? =
You can automate the generation of alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for images by selecting 'Media files' within the 'Set up SEO Autopilot' modal. This modal can be accessed by clicking the 'Set up SEO Autopilot'-button within the 'SEO Autopilot (Bulk Generation)'-section on the *AI for SEO* dashboard of your WordPress website.

= Can I turn off the automation feature after I've activated it? =
Yes, simply deactivate the checkbox next to the desired content type within the 'Set up SEO Autopilot' modal. This modal can be accessed by clicking the 'Set up SEO Autopilot'-button within the 'SEO Autopilot (Bulk Generation)'-section on the *AI for SEO* dashboard of your WordPress website. If you would like to disable the automation for every content type entirely you can click the 'Stop SEO Autopilot' link within the 'SEO Autopilot (Bulk Generation)'-section on the *AI for SEO* dashboard of your WordPress website.

= Does the SEO Autopilot (bulk generation) feature work for new content? =
Yes! You can decide exactly how the SEO Autopilot behaves. By default, the plugin will automatically generate metadata and media attributes for both new and existing content. However, you can now customize this behavior using three available options:
New entries and existing entries
New entries only
Existing entries only

You can change these settings anytime via the 'Set Up SEO Autopilot' modal. Just click the 'Set up SEO Autopilot' button in the 'SEO Autopilot (Bulk Generation)' section on your *AI for SEO* dashboard.

= Will the SEO Autopilot (bulk generation) feature affect existing data (meta-title, meta-description, etc.)? =
Not by default. However, you can enable the 'Overwrite Existing Metadata (SEO Autopilot Only)'-option in the settings if needed.

= Is there any way to control what meta tags are outputted? =
Yes, in the 'Meta Tag Inclusion:'-section of the settings, you can choose to include or exclude specific meta tags from the header output generated by our plugin. This gives you full control to customize the meta tags based on your specific requirements.

= Can I choose which media attributes the plugin should generate? =
Yes, *AI for SEO* lets you decide which media attributes (like 'alt text' or 'title') should be generated. You can configure this in the 'Active Media Attributes:' section of the settings to match your content needs. Simply select the desired attributes and the SEO Autopilot will generate the data accordingly.

= How can I retry all failed metadata generations with just one click? =
You can find the 'Retry all failed' button in any content tab (e.g. Pages, Posts or media). This allows you to retry all failed metadata generations with a single click, saving you time and effort. Please note that this button will only be displayed if at least one error has occurred.

= Why is the automatic metadata or media attributes generation pending? =
We use WordPress's internal task scheduler to manage automatic generation efficiently. This helps prevent overloading your server with too many simultaneous tasks.

If you see a 'Pending' status in the 'SEO coverage' column, it means one of two things:

1. The plugin is waiting for the next scheduled task to run (typically within 1-5 minutes).
2. The plugin is currently generating data for other entries.

You can check the *AI for SEO* dashboard to see if any generation is in progress for other items. If many items are pending, it may take longer to process them all.

Rest assured, the plugin will automatically generate data for all pending items over time. If you need immediate results, you can use the manual generation option for specific items.

= How do I navigate to the page I want to edit for SEO? =
You can navigate to the page or post you want to edit through the normal editor, using a page builder like Elementor, or by opening the page directly in the frontend.

= Where is the *AI for SEO* metadata editor located? =
You can find the *AI for SEO* button in the top admin-bar. Clicking on this will open up the metadata editor where you can modify or generate metadata.

= How can I generate or edit metadata? =
After opening *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor, you can either edit the existing metadata manually or generate new metadata using the 'Generate with AI' buttons.

= Is there an alternate way to access *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor? =
Yes, alternatively, you can go to the 'Pages' or 'Posts' tab within the *AI for SEO* plugin. From there, you can browse through your pages and posts, and choose the ones you want to edit.

= What editors are supported? =
We currently support Elementor, BeTheme (Muffin-Builder / Be-Builder) and the standard editor. We are working on supporting more editors.

= Are Credits renewed in the Free plan? =
The free plan renews on a daily basis. You will receive 5 free Credits every day, allowing you to continue using the basic features of the plugin at no cost.

= What do I need to do to receive the free daily Credits? =
You don't need to do anythingâ€”they'll be automatically added to your account every day. Just make sure the plugin remains active on your website.

= Will I still receive the free daily Credits if I'm on a paid subscription? =
Yes, you'll continue to receive the free daily Credits even if you're on a paid subscription. These Credits are in addition to those included in your subscription.

= How are Credits consumed in the *AI for SEO* plugin? =
Credits are consumed when the AI generates metadata or media attributes for your content entries. Each generation costs 5 Credits, regardless of the content's word count or image size.
Please note that Credits are not consumed when you manually edit the metadata or media attributes. Also, Credits-wise, it does not make a difference if you only generate metadata for a single field (e.g., the title) or for all fields at once.

Yes, the free plan provides you with 100 Credits, allowing you to experiment with AI-generated SEO content without any cost. In addition, we provide you with 5 free Credits every day.

= I can't remove the AI-generated text within the Yoast SEO plugin =

= How do I edit metadata in Elementor with *AI for SEO*? =

2. Click on the settings-button (cog-icon) located at the top of the Elementor header to reveal page-/post-settings.

3. Click on the 'Show all SEO settings' button within the SEO section to open *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor. Here, you can access and manipulate the metadata using AI-driven algorithms.

= Is AI-generated SEO-content harmful to my SEO-ranking? =
Currently, Google's stance on the use of AI or automation in content creation is generally permissive, as indicated in a Google Developers blog post from February 2023. They state that appropriate use of AI or automation is not against their guidelines. More information can be found at https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content.

= Will *AI for SEO* slow down my website? =
The plugin is optimized for maximum performance and we are not aware of any noticeable performance effects on the backend or the frontend.

= Can you add feature x, y or z to the plugin? =
We are always open to suggestions and feedback. Please email us at [info@aiforseo.ai](mailto:info@aiforseo.ai) with your suggestions.

= Does *AI for SEO* support multi-language websites? =
Yes, the plugin does support multi-language websites. The plugin also supports the WPML-plugin through which you can generate metadata and media attributes for all available languages separately.

= What is the recommended cron job setting for WordPress? =
The best setup is to use a cronjob outside the WordPress cron system (external cron job, either on your own server or through a third-party service) that runs every minute. This ensures that the SEO Autopilot and scheduled tasks run smoothly without being dependent on WordPress's internal cron system, which may not execute reliably on low-traffic sites.

= I use the WordPress internal cron job system. What should I consider? =
If possible, switch to a cron job system outside the WordPress cron system (external cron job, either on your own server or through a third-party service) that runs every minute. If this is not an option and you experience slow SEO Autopilot, consider increasing the SEO Autopilot Duration setting (Settings > Experimental > SEO Autopilot Duration) to allow more processing time per batch.

= I use an external cron job system, but I can only run the cron job every 2+ minutes or less frequently. What should I do? =
If your external cron job runs less frequently than every minute, we recommend increasing the SEO Autopilot Duration setting (Settings > Experimental > SEO Autopilot Duration). This will allow each SEO Autopilot cycle to handle more tasks at once, compensating for the lower execution frequency.

= The SEO Autopilot ignored some entries or marked them as already completed. What can I do? =
By default, the SEO Autopilot skips entries that already have a complete set of metadata or media attributes, assuming they are already optimized.

If you want to regenerate metadata or media attributes even for entries that are marked as complete:

Enable "Include Complete Entries When Overwriting (SEO Autopilot Only)" in the Metadata section.
Enable "Include Complete Entries When Overwriting (SEO Autopilot Only)" in the Media Attributes section.
You can find these options in the plugin settings. This will force the SEO Autopilot to overwrite all existing metadata and media attributes, even if they are already set.

= I see old data in the plugin while generating metadata or media attributes. What can I do? =
If you notice outdated data appearing while generating metadata or media attributes, try the following steps:

1. Reset Cache â€“ This will clear stored data and forces the plugin to eventually create new temporary data (cache).
2. If the issue persists, Reset Environmental Variables â€“ This can help resolve cases where incorrect internal values are affecting data processing.

You can find both options under Help > Troubleshooting > Reset Plugin.

= How can I reset the plugin settings to their default values? =
If you want to revert the plugin settings to their default state: Use the Reset Settings option under Help > Troubleshooting > Reset Plugin. This will restore all settings to their original values but will not delete generated metadata or media attributes.

= I want to uninstall the plugin and remove all generated data. How can I do this? =
If you want to fully remove all generated metadata and plugin data before uninstalling:

1. Go to Help > Troubleshooting > Reset Plugin and select every checkbox.
2. Deactivate and uninstall the plugin.

Note: Media Attributes and synced metadata (to third-party SEO plugins) cannot be removed or undone by the reset. You will need to manually update or remove them in their respective editors.

= Will all the generated texts disappear if I uninstall the plugin? =
It depends on how the metadata is stored and used. If *AI for SEO* has synchronized the generated metadata with a third-party SEO plugin like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, or similar, then the metadata will remain even after uninstalling *AI for SEO*. You can check and enable synchronization in your *AI for SEO* settings.

However, if synchronization was not enabled, and *AI for SEO* was solely responsible for outputting meta tags on your site, then those tags will no longer be generated once the plugin is deactivated or uninstalled.

= I used the wrong settings for manual or bulk generation (e.g., wrong language or missing sync with other SEO plugins). What can I do? =
If you generated metadata or media attributes with incorrect settings, follow these steps:

1. Use "Reset Generated Data" under Help > Troubleshooting > Reset Plugin to remove all generated metadata. Media files are marked as "not generated" and can be reprocessed again.
2. If the generated metadata was already synced with a third-party SEO plugin, consider enabling: "Include Complete Entries When Overwriting (SEO Autopilot Only)" in the Metadata section.
3. If you generated media attributes, consider enabling: "Include Complete Entries When Overwriting (SEO Autopilot Only)" in the Media Attributes section.
These settings will allow the plugin to regenerate and overwrite metadata and media attributes, even for entries that were previously marked as complete.

= I use the NextGen Gallery plugin â€” how do I generate media attributes for my images? =
To import all images from the NextGen Gallery into AI for SEO, click the Import button in the Media section. Once imported, you can generate alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for these images using the plugin. All changes will automatically sync with the NextGen Gallery plugin.
